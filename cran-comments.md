## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:
* Add the 'cran-comments.md' file into the `.Rbuildignore`.
* Fix the note on `LazyData` by removing the line from DESCRIPTION file.


## Test environments
* local R installation, R 4.0.4
* ubuntu 16.04 (on travis-ci), R 4.0.4
* win-builder (devel)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* The note is due to this package being a new release.
